## List of No Love

* Rudeness or perpetual disrespect. Don't get me wrong: I get hangry and inconsolable sometimes and words that I regret have been known to escape before it was too late to take them back. But if someone repeatedly treats me or others with disrespect and doesn't acknowledge the hurt they cause, I don't care fot it and will not tolerate it.
* Needless complexity. 
* Gaslighting, especially when done by privileged folks to marginalize others and minimize their lived experiences.
